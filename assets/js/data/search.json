A Markdown-formatteddocument should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without lookinglike it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. WhileMarkdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTMLfilters – including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText,Grutatext, and EtText – the single biggest source ofinspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.Block ElementsParagraphs and Line BreaksA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separatedby one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like ablank line – a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is consideredblank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.The implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule isthat Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differssignificantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including MovableType’s “Convert Line Breaks” option) which translate every line breakcharacter in a paragraph into a &lt;br /&gt; tag.When you do want to insert a &lt;br /&gt; break tag using Markdown, youend a line with two or more spaces, then type return.HeadersMarkdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].Optionally, you may “close” atx-style headers. This is purelycosmetic – you can use this if you think it looks better. Theclosing hashes don’t even need to match the number of hashesused to open the header. (The number of opening hashesdetermines the header level.)BlockquotesMarkdown uses email-style &gt; characters for blockquoting. If you’refamiliar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then youknow how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hardwrap the text and put a &gt; before every line: This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisseid sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the &gt; before the firstline of a hard-wrapped paragraph: This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisseid sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) byadding additional levels of &gt;: This is the first level of quoting. This is nested blockquote. Back to the first level.Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,and code blocks: This is a header. This is the first list item. This is the second list item. Here’s some example code: return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $markdown_script\"); Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. Forexample, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose IncreaseQuote Level from the Text menu.ListsMarkdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens – interchangably– as list markers: Red Green Blueis equivalent to: Red Green Blueand: Red Green BlueOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods: Bird McHale ParishIt’s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark thelist have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTMLMarkdown produces from the above list is:If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this: Bird McHale Parishor even: Bird McHale Parishyou’d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so thatthe numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.But if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to.To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.But if you want to be lazy, you don’t have to: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequentparagraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spacesor one tab: This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolorsit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendreritmi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreetvitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsumsit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing. It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequentparagraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to belazy: This is a list item with two paragraphs. This is the second paragraph in the list item. You’reonly required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolorsit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Another item in the same list. To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote’s &gt;delimiters need to be indented: A list item with a blockquote: This is a blockquoteinside a list item. To put a code block within a list item, the code block needsto be indented twice – 8 spaces or two tabs: A list item with a code block: &lt;code goes here&gt; Code BlocksPre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming ormarkup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the linesof a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code blockin both &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags.To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of theblock by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.This is a normal paragraph:This is a code block.Here is an example of AppleScript:tell application \"Foo\" beepend tellA code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented(or the end of the article).Within a code block, ampersands (&amp;) and angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;)are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it veryeasy to include example HTML source code using Markdown – just pasteit and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding theampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:&lt;div class=\"footer\"&gt; &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation&lt;/div&gt;Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This meansit’s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown’s own syntax.tell application \"Foo\" beepend tellSpan ElementsLinksMarkdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediatelyafter the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optionaltitle for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:This is an example inline link.This link has no title attribute.EmphasisMarkdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators ofemphasis. Text wrapped with one * or _ will be wrapped with anHTML &lt;em&gt; tag; double *’s or _’s will be wrapped with an HTML&lt;strong&gt; tag. E.g., this input:single asteriskssingle underscoresdouble asterisksdouble underscoresCodeTo indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`).Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within anormal paragraph. For example:Use the printf() function." }, { "title": "Migrate my blogging framework from Hexo to jekyll", "url": "/posts/migrate-to-Jekyll/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2024-11-24 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "博客框架从Hexo迁移到jekyllHello world！", "content": "博客框架从Hexo迁移到jekyllHello world！" } ]
